    "## Introduction\n",
    "Greetings! I'm on an exciting journey in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia, fueled by a solid foundation in statistics and neuroscience from my undergraduate days. I thrive on exploring the intricacies of data, uncovering trends, and seamlessly applying those insights in unexpected domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "My latest role in the relam of data science was working as a Data Science Intern at Teck Resources Limited. There, I delved into the world of Hugging Face transformers and the BERT model, tackling NLP challenges with gusto. Beyond the realm of data, you'll often find me indulging my creative side by sketching and immersing myself in music across various genres during my free moments. Excited to share my journey in the world of data! üöÄüé®üé∂"
